    <h1>University of Pittsburgh Computer Science Club (Pitt CSC)</h1><hr/>
    <p>We are a group of dedicated students showcasing our shared passion for computer science.  During weekly meetings, there are speakers, workshops, and field trips throughout the school year.  This organization hopes to bridge the gap between computer science education in the classroom and practical experience in the real world.  This not only produces students with valuable skills for employers, but also allows us to portray Pitt's CS department as willing and able to produce useful software for real world applications.  Our website can be found at <a href="www.pittcsc.org" target="_blank">pittcsc.org</a>.  If you're curious about talking to any of the contributors on this project or how to support our club in the production of even cooler projects, please contact any of our officers.</p>

    <h1>About this Project</h1><hr/>
    <p>This project aims to gather useful data around the Oakland area of Pittsburgh to inform students and other occupants about libraries, computer labs, police data, and more.  With the help of WPRDC (Western Pennsylvania's Regional Data Center), several JavaScript libraries, and hardwork, this group of volunteers was able to successfully visualize several large datasets in a web interface.</p>
    <p>This started as a small club project but has grown to include tens of people contributing in a plethora of ways, whether it's graphic design, connecting to the datasets, or visualization in the actual map applet.</p>
    <p>By far the best part of this project is that anybody can contribute! Any interested person can contribute by designing logos, suggesting improvements, or learning how to code and contributing directly to the application. The process is simplified and easy; grab an issue or mess around with PantherView to find bugs/improvements and send a pull request to the repository! No matter your skill level, background, or school, we can always use more hands to make PantherView even more polished and useful for the Oakland community.</p>
    <p>Users can filter map pins in Oakland for more dire city functions such as police involvement, arrests, code violations, 311s, and non-traffic violations.  In addition, general everyday useful functions like locations of libraries, computer labs, and laundry facilities are available.  One can view data from the previous day, week, or month, which greatly displays the changing atmosphere of Oakland to stay up-to-date on the happenings of the area.  If you feel like viewing all data at once, there is the option to view a data table instead of the interactive map.  The table shows the category of the activity, date it occurred, location (which specific part of Oakland), and a description.</p>
    <p>From small club project to city-wide utility, this project has quite the future.  Visions for the future involve adding City of Pittsburgh police data rather than solely Pitt police, expanding it to nearby universities (namely CMU), and also providing useful utility information such as specific university buildings, printers, and restaurant vacancy.  Obviously, these are just a couple of ideas, so please leave any feedback you have!</p>
